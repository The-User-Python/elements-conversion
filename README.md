## Here We Will Be Learning About Basic Function's Of Python

# What is Python?

Python is a highlevel programming language , hence which is also known as Object Oriented Language . It is the most easiest language   to learn . It uses simple - basic syntaxe's which we will learn here .  [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_programming_language) 

# Why Should I learn Python First? Why not to try some other Languages first like C/C++ ?

Hmmm , It's a good question. So basically as You know Python is a very asy language as it uses Intrepreter to run the code . For       Example if you put a code ->  
  
                                a=10
                                b=20
                                print(a+b)
                                
                Hence Output -> 30
                
         But if you put C or D -> The code will not execute and hence it will show ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
                              <ipython-input-2-3984b433e022> in <module>
                                1 a=10
                                2 b=20
                          ----> 3 print(a+b+c)

                         NameError: name 'c' is not defined
                         
This is why you should learn Python first , by using simple human language you can easily understand the concept of the language , Where as the language C / C++ contain's Compiler in which a Programmer must have to enter whole code correctly or else the whole programm will not run until and unless it is programmed again with correct statement's and logic . 

Example if you put code ---> 
                                 
                                 
                                 #include <stdio.h>    
                        int main()
                    { 
                      // Displays the string inside quotations
                          printf("C Programming");
                           return 0;
                        }
                        
                The Output ---> C programming 
                
                
                          But if you code it worngly then ---->  gcc /tmp/BKVH65M3PR.c -lm
                                                 /tmp/BKVH65M3PR.c: In function 'main':
                                /tmp/BKVH65M3PR.c:6:5: error: expected declaration or statement at end of input
                                    6 |     return 0;
                                      |     ^~~~~~
                                      
                 why error? becuase you forgot } in the end of the program   
                 
So this is why you should learn Python first . These code are taken from [programiz.com](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming)               
# Now What Kind Of Software Should You Use? 
See if you'r computer/Pc/Mac is good enough so you can download Python directly on you're computer . You can download from here   [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/), For Mac-Book [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/), For Other        Platform's [Python](https://www.python.org/download/other/). These all releases are Provided by Python.org Official Site [Python](https://www.python.org/) 
  
  If you're not able to download Python on you're Window's don't be sad :cry: , Because my Laptop too doesn't support . But don't worry you can use [Anaconda-Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) for using Python , This Anaconda Distribution is also Open-Source project , you can do changes in it . NOTE: Anaconda is a big file make sure you're computer/pc/laptop has enough memory/storage . Or else you can simpley use Google Collab [Google-Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/) This platform will help you to connect python and can help you to show how much data you're python is consuming here is the image as an example 
  ![Screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97610126/224493805-905c8efa-ad08-45f1-8c1c-6d0d018879c9.png) . The Yellow Mark are the example you can change the name of the file and connect to python from the top right corner .

# Now Some Coding Practice 
 
So usually you have to start with basic's like 
  
  
                                 a=10
                                 b=20
    
write the coding command - So the command is Print(a+b) = Output---> 30 

Let's try some diffrent command's 

      Int ---> a=10 
              print((a), type(a))
              
    Output ---> 10<Class 'int'>  
    
      str  ---> a='10'
               print((a), type(a))
  
     Output ---> 10<Class 'str'>      
    
    float  ---> a=10.0
               print((a), type(a))
               
    Output ----> 10,0<Class 'float'>
    
    Bool   ---> a=True
               print((a), type(a))
               
    Output ---> True<Class 'bool'> 
    
    
Hence for clear Image you can see this image ![Screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97610126/224502246-4f3c2065-9959-46e1-8db2-71bbaefcdb54.png)
